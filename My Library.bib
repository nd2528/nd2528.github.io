	abstract = {Heterozygous mutations in GBA, the gene encoding the lysosomal enzyme glucosylceramidase beta/$\beta$-glucocerebrosidase, comprise the most common genetic risk factor for Parkinson disease (PD), but the mechanisms underlying this association remain unclear. Here, we show that in GbaL444P/WT knockin mice, the L444P heterozygous Gba mutation triggers mitochondrial dysfunction by inhibiting autophagy and mitochondrial priming, two steps critical for the selective removal of dysfunctional mitochondria by autophagy, a process known as mitophagy. In SHSY-5Y neuroblastoma cells, the overexpression of L444P GBA impeded mitochondrial priming and autophagy induction when endogenous lysosomal GBA activity remained intact. By contrast, genetic depletion of GBA inhibited lysosomal clearance of autophagic cargo. The link between heterozygous GBA mutations and impaired mitophagy was corroborated in postmortem brain tissue from PD patients carrying heterozygous GBA mutations, where we found increased mitochondrial content, mitochondria oxidative stress and impaired autophagy. Our findings thus suggest a mechanistic basis for mitochondrial dysfunction associated with GBA heterozygous mutations.

	abstract = {Background: In traditional models of essential tremor, the inferior olivary nucleus was posited to play a central role as the pacemaker for the tremor. However, recent data call this disease model into question.
Case presentation: Our patient had progressive, long-standing, familial essential tremor. Upper limb tremor began at age 10 and worsened over time. It continued to worsen during the nine-year period he was enrolled in our brain donation program (age 85 - 94~years), during which time the tremor moved from the moderate to severe range on examination. On postmortem examination at age 94, there were degenerative changes in the cerebellar cortex, as have been described in the essential tremor literature. Additionally, there was marked degeneration of the inferior olivary nucleus, which was presumed to be of more recent onset. Such degeneration has not been previously described in essential tremor postmortems. Despite the presence of this degeneration, the patient's tremor not only persisted but it continued to worsen during the final decade of his life.
Conclusions: Although the pathophysiology of essential tremor is not completely understood, evidence such as this suggests that the inferior olivary nucleus does not play a critical role in the generation of tremor in these patients.},

METHODS: A comprehensive systematic review was performed according to American Academy of Neurology methodology.
CONCLUSIONS: For patients with episodic ataxia type 2, 4-aminopyridine 15 mg/d probably reduces ataxia attack frequency over 3 months (1 Class I study). For patients with ataxia of mixed etiology, riluzole probably improves ataxia signs at 8 weeks (1 Class I study). For patients with Friedreich ataxia or spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), riluzole probably improves ataxia signs at 12 months (1 Class I study). For patients with SCA type 3, valproic acid 1,200 mg/d possibly improves ataxia at 12 weeks. For patients with spinocerebellar degeneration, thyrotropin-releasing hormone possibly improves some ataxia signs over 10 to 14 days (1 Class II study). For patients with SCA type 3 who are ambulatory, lithium probably does not improve signs of ataxia over 48 weeks (1 Class I study). For patients with Friedreich ataxia, deferiprone possibly worsens ataxia signs over 6 months (1 Class II study). Data are insufficient to support or refute the use of numerous agents. For nonpharmacologic options, in patients with degenerative ataxias, 4-week inpatient rehabilitation probably improves ataxia and function (1 Class I study); transcranial magnetic stimulation possibly improves cerebellar motor signs at 21 days (1 Class II study). For patients with multiple sclerosis-associated ataxia, the addition of pressure splints possibly has no additional benefit compared with neuromuscular rehabilitation alone (1 Class II study). Data are insufficient to support or refute use of stochastic whole-body vibration therapy (1 Class III study).},

Methods: One hundred fifty PD patients were enrolled from the Parkinson`s disease and Movement Disorders Center~in~ Department of Neurology, Shanghai General Hospital from January 2013 to August 2014. This study examined PD patients with or without RBD as determined by the REM Sleep Behavior Disorder Screening Questionnaire (RBDSQ), assessed motor subtype by Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS) III at "on" state, and compared the sub-scale scores representing tremor, rigidity, appendicular and axial. Investigators also assessed the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), and Parkinson's disease Sleep Scale (PDSS).
Results: One hundred fourty one PD patients entered the final study. 30 (21.28\%) PD patients had probable RBD (pRBD) diagnosed with a RBDSQ score of 6 or above. There were no significant differences for age, including age of PD onset and PD duration, gender, smoking status, alcohol or coffee use, presence of anosmia or freezing, UPDRS III, and H-Y stages between the pRBD+ and pRBD- groups. pRBD+ group had lower MMSE scores, higher PDSS scores, and pRBD+ PD patients had more prominent proportion in anxiety, depression, constipation, hallucination and a greater prevalence of orthostatic hypotension.
Conclusion: pRBD+ PD patients exhibited greater changes in non-motor symptoms. However, there was no increase in motor deficits.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Essential tremor (ET) is heterogeneous in nature and cases may be subdivided based on clinical features. ET patients may thus be subdivided by age of onset, family history of tremor, and presence of head tremor. We recently described climbing fiber-Purkinje cell (CF-PC) synaptic abnormalities in ET; however, these CF pathological features have not been studied across different ET subtypes.
OBJECTIVES: To explore whether these CF-PC synaptic abnormalities differ across ET subtypes.
METHODS: We studied two climbing fiber (CF-PC) synaptic pathologies (CF synaptic density and percentage of CFs in the parallel fiber [PF] territory) in the cerebella of 60 ET cases with a range of clinical presentations and 30 age-matched controls.
RESULTS: Compared to controls, ET cases had lower CF synaptic density and a higher percentage of CFs in the PF territory. ET cases with tremor onset {\textless}50 years and tremor onset >= 50 years did not differ significantly with respect to CF synaptic density and percentage of CFs in the PF territory. Similar results were found when comparing familial vs. sporadic ET cases, and ET cases with head tremor vs. those without head tremor. Among all ET cases, lower CF synaptic density was associated with lower PC counts and higher torpedo counts. In addition, higher percentage of CFs in the PF territory was associated with lower PC counts and higher torpedo counts.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the notion that changes in the distribution of CF-PC synapses are broadly part of the neurodegenerative process in the ET cerebellum.},

	abstract = {Background: Tremor is the most common movement disorder; however, the pathophysiology of tremor remains elusive. While several neuropathological alterations in tremor disorders have been observed in post-mortem studies of human brains, a full understanding of the relationship between brain circuitry alterations and tremor requires testing in animal models. Additionally, tremor animal models are critical for our understanding of tremor pathophysiology, and/or to serve as a platform for therapy development.
Methods: A PubMed search was conducted in May 2018 to identify published papers for review.
Results: The methodology used in most studies on animal models of tremor lacks standardized measurement of tremor frequency and amplitude; instead, these studies are based on the visual inspection of phenotypes, which may fail to delineate tremor from other movement disorders such as ataxia. Of the animal models with extensive tremor characterization, harmaline-induced rodent tremor models provide an important framework showing that rhythmic and synchronous neuronal activities within the olivocerebellar circuit can drive action tremor. In addition, dopamine-depleted monkey and mouse models may develop rest tremor, highlighting the role of dopamine in rest tremor generation. Finally, other animal models of tremor have involvement of the cerebellar circuitry, leading to altered Purkinje cell physiology.
Discussion: Both the cerebellum and the basal ganglia are likely to play a role in tremor generation. While the cerebellar circuitry can generate rhythmic movements, the nigrostriatal system is likely to modulate the tremor circuit. Tremor disorders are heterogeneous in nature. Therefore, each animal model may represent a subset of tremor disorders, which collectively can advance our understanding of tremor.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dystonia is a common feature in spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs). Whether the presence of dystonia is associated with different rate of ataxia progression is not known.
OBJECTIVES: To study clinical characteristics and ataxia progression in SCAs with and without dystonia.
METHODS: We studied 334 participants with SCA 1, 2, 3 and 6 from the Clinical Research Consortium for Spinocerebellar Ataxias (CRC-SCA) and compared the clinical characteristics of SCAs with and without dystonia. We repeatedly measured ataxia progression by the Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia every 6 months for 2 years. Regression models were employed to study the association between dystonia and ataxia progression after adjusting for age, sex and pathological CAG repeats. We used logistic regression to analyze the impact of different repeat expansion genes on dystonia in SCAs.
RESULTS: Dystonia was most commonly observed in SCA3, followed by SCA2, SCA1, and SCA6. Dystonia was associated with longer CAG repeats in SCA3. The CAG repeat number in TBP normal alleles appeared to modify the presence of dystonia in SCA1. The presence of dystonia was associated with higher SARA scores in SCA1, 2, and 3. Although relatively rare in SCA6, the presence of dystonia was associated with slower progression of ataxia.
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of dystonia is associated with greater severity of ataxia in SCA1, 2, and 3, but predictive of a slower progression in SCA6. Complex genetic interactions among repeat expansion genes can lead to diverse clinical symptoms and progression in SCAs.},

	abstract = {Several morphological changes, centered in/around Purkinje cells (PCs), have been identified in the cerebellum of essential tremor (ET) patients. These changes have not been contextualized within a broader degenerative disease spectrum, limiting their interpretability. To address this, we compared the severity and patterning of degenerative changes within the cerebellar cortex in patients with ET, other neurodegenerative disorders of the cerebellum (spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), multiple system atrophy (MSA)], and other disorders that may involve the cerebellum [Parkinson's disease (PD), dystonia]. Using a postmortem series of 156 brains [50 ET, 23 SCA (6 SCA3; 17 SCA 1, 2 or 6), 15 MSA, 29 PD, 14 dystonia, 25 controls], we generated data on 37 quantitative morphologic metrics, which were grouped into 8 broad categories: (1) PC loss, (2) heterotopic PCs, (3) PC dendritic changes, (4) PC axonal changes (torpedoes), (5) PC axonal changes (other than torpedoes), (6) PC axonal changes (torpedo-associated), (7) basket cell axonal hypertrophy, (8) climbing fiber-PC synaptic changes. Our analyses used z scored raw data for each metric across all diagnoses (5772 total data items). Principal component analysis revealed that diagnostic groups were not uniform with respect to cerebellar pathology. Dystonia and PD each differed from controls in only 2/37 metrics, whereas ET differed in 21, SCA3 in 8, MSA in 19, and SCA1/2/6 in 26 metrics. Comparing ET with primary disorders of cerebellar degeneration (i.e., SCAs), we observed a spectrum of changes reflecting differences of degree, being generally mild in ET and SCA3 and more severe in SCA1/2/6. Comparative analyses across morphologic categories demonstrated differences in relative expression, defining distinctive patterns of changes in these groups. Thus, the degree of cerebellar degeneration in ET aligns it with a milder end in the spectrum of cerebellar degenerative disorders, and a somewhat distinctive signature of degenerative changes marks each of these disorders.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Few systematic methods prioritize the image education in medical students (MS). We hope to develop a checklist of brain computerized tomography (CT) reading in patients with suspected acute ischemic stroke (AIS) for MS and primary care (PC) physicians.
METHODS: Our pilot group generated the items indicating specific structures or signs for the checklist of brain CT reading in suspected AIS patients for MS and PC physicians. These items were used in a modified web-based Delphi process using the online software "SurveyMonkey". In total 15 panelists including neurologists, neurosurgeons, neuroradiologists, and emergency department physicians participated in the modified Delphi process. Each panelist was encouraged to express feedback, agreement or disagreement on the inclusion of each item using a 9-point Likert scale. Items with median scores of 7-9 were included in our final checklist.
RESULTS: Fifty-two items were initially provided for the first round of the Delphi process. Of these, 35 achieved general agreement of being an essential item for the MS and PC physicians. The other 17 of the 52 items in this round and another two added items suggested by the panelists were further rated in the next round. Finally, 38 items were included in the essential checklist items of brain CT reading in suspected AIS patients for MS and PC physicians.
CONCLUSIONS: We established a reference regarding the essential items of brain CT reading in suspected AIS patients. We hope this helps to minimize malpractice and a delayed diagnosis, and to improve competency-based medical education for MS and PC physicians.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article reviews the symptoms, laboratory and neuroimaging diagnostic tests, genetics, and management of cerebellar ataxia.
RECENT FINDINGS: Recent advances in genetics have led to the identification of novel genetic causes for ataxia and a more comprehensive understanding of the biological pathways critical for normal cerebellar function. When these molecular pathways become dysfunctional, patients develop cerebellar ataxia. In addition, several ongoing clinical trials for Friedreich ataxia and spinocerebellar ataxia will likely result in novel symptomatic and disease-modifying therapies for ataxia. Antisense oligonucleotides for spinocerebellar ataxias associated with CAG repeat expansions might be a promising therapeutic strategy.
SUMMARY: Cerebellar ataxias include heterogeneous disorders affecting cerebellar function, leading to ataxic symptoms. Step-by-step diagnostic workups with genetic investigations are likely to reveal the underlying causes of ataxia. Some disease-specific therapies for ataxia exist, such as vitamin E for ataxia with vitamin E deficiency and thiamine for Wernicke encephalopathy, highlighting the importance of recognizing these forms of ataxia. Finally, genetic diagnosis for patients with ataxia will accelerate clinical trials for disease-modifying therapy and will have prognostic value and implications for family planning for these patients.},

	abstract = {Essential tremor (ET) is one of the most common neurological diseases, with a central feature of an 8-12 Hz kinetic tremor. While previous postmortem studies have identified a cluster of morphological changes in the ET cerebellum centered in/around the Purkinje cell (PC) population, including a loss of PCs in some studies, the underlying molecular mechanisms for these changes are not clear. As genomic studies of ET patients have yet to identify major genetic contributors and animal models that fully recapitulate the human disease do not yet exist, the study of human tissue is currently the most applicable method to gain a mechanistic insight into ET disease pathogenesis. To begin exploration of an underlying molecular source of ET disease pathogenesis, we have performed the first transcriptomic analysis by direct sequencing of RNA from frozen cerebellar cortex tissue in 33 ET patients compared to 21 normal controls. Principal component analysis showed a heterogenous distribution of the expression data in ET patients that only partially overlapped with control patients. Differential expression analysis identified 231 differentially expressed gene transcripts ('top gene hits'), a subset of which has defined expression profiles in the cerebellum across neuronal and glial cell types but a largely unknown relationship to cerebellar function and/or ET pathogenesis. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) identified dysregulated pathways of interest and stratified dysregulation among ET cases. By GSEA and mining curated databases, we compiled major categories of dysregulated processes and clustered string networks of known interacting proteins. Here we demonstrate that these 'top gene hits' contribute to regulation of four main biological processes, which are 1) axon guidance, 2) microtubule motor activity, 3) endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to Golgi transport and 4) calcium signaling/synaptic transmission. The results of our transcriptomic analysis suggest there is a range of different processes involved among ET cases, and draws attention to a particular set of genes and regulatory pathways that provide an initial platform to further explore the underlying biology of ET.},

DESIGN: Fourteen adults with cerebellar degeneration were recruited, and ataxia severity was determined using the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA). The median SARA score was used to divide participants into less and more severe ataxia groups. The two groups' average scores on the hand function tests were compared, and correlation of each test with ataxia severity was determined.
RESULTS: The 9HPT, BBT, and JTHFT all differentiated between less and more severe ataxia groups, and the 9HPT performed with the participant's dominant hand had the highest correlation with ataxia severity (rs=.92, p{\textless}.01). Although accuracy, precision, and number of sub-movements were statistically different between healthy individuals and the more ataxic participant group, most kinematic measures were not significantly different between the less and more severe ataxic groups.
CONCLUSION: Overall, our results indicate that all three clinical tests correlate with ataxia severity. Larger future studies should examine the reliability and validity of these hand function measures in adults with degenerative cerebellar disease.},

Previous studies found the cerebellar volume changes over the course of AD disease progression; however, whether cerebellar volume change contributes to the cognitive decline in AD,~or its earlier disease stage (i.e., mild cognitive impairment [MCI]) remains unclear. In ADNI,~cognitive function was assessed using Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Behavior section (ADAS-Cog). We used linear regression and linear mixed effects models to examine whether cerebellar volume is associated with either baseline cognition or with cognitive changes over time in MCI or in AD. We used logistic regression to assess the relationship between cerebellar volume and disease progression to MCI and AD. We found that~cerebellar volume is associated with cognition in patients with MCI, after adjusting for age, gender, education, hippocampal volume, and APOE4 status. Consistently, cerebellar volume is associated with increased odds of the disease stages of MCI and AD when compared to controls. However, cerebellar volume is not associated with cognitive changes over time in either MCI or AD. In summary,~cerebellar volume may contribute to cognition level in MCI, but not in AD, indicating that the cerebellar network might modulate the cognitive function in the early stage of the disease. The cerebellum may be a potential target for neuromodulation in treating MCI.},

Although motor and balance deficits are the core symptoms of SCA1, cognitive decline is also commonly observed in patients. While mutant ATXN1 is expressed throughout the brain, pathological findings reveal severe atrophy of cerebellar cortex in SCA1 patients. The cerebellum has recently been implicated in diverse cognitive functions, yet to what extent cerebellar neurodegeneration contributes to cognitive alterations in SCA1 remains poorly understood. Much of our understanding of the mechanisms underlying pathogenesis of motor symptoms in SCA1 comes from mouse models. Reasoning that mouse models could similarly offer important insights into the mechanisms of cognitive alterations in SCA1, we tested cognition in several mouse lines using Barnes maze and fear conditioning. We confirmed cognitive deficits in Atxn1154Q/2Q knock-in mice with brain-wide expression of mutant ATXN1 and in ATXN1 null mice. We found that shorter polyQ length and haploinsufficiency of ATXN1 do not cause significant cognitive deficits. Finally, ATXN1[82Q ] transgenic mice-with cerebellum limited expression of mutant ATXN1-demonstrated milder impairment in most aspects of cognition compared to Atxn1154Q/2Q mice, supporting the concept that cognitive deficits in SCA1 arise from a combination of cerebellar and extra-cerebellar dysfunctions.},

However, the pathophysiology of tremor generation in ET remains unclear. Here, we used autoptic cerebral tissue from patients with ET, clinical data, and mouse models to report that synaptic pruning deficits of climbing fiber (CF)-to-Purkinje cell (PC) synapses, which are related to glutamate receptor delta 2 (GluR$\delta$2) protein insufficiency, cause excessive cerebellar oscillations and might be responsible for tremor. The CF-PC synaptic pruning deficits were correlated with the reduction in GluR$\delta$2 expression in the postmortem ET cerebellum. Mice with GluR$\delta$2 insufficiency and CF-PC synaptic pruning deficits develop ET-like tremor that can be suppressed with viral rescue of GluR$\delta$2 protein. Step-by-step optogenetic or pharmacological inhibition of neuronal firing, axonal activity, or synaptic vesicle release confirmed that the activity of the excessive CF-to-PC synapses is required for tremor generation. In vivo electrophysiology in mice showed that excessive cerebellar oscillatory activity is CF dependent and necessary for tremor and optogenetic-driven PC synchronization was sufficient to generate tremor in wild-type animals. Human validation by cerebellar electroencephalography confirmed that excessive cerebellar oscillations also exist in patients with ET. Our findings identify a pathophysiologic contribution to tremor at molecular (GluR$\delta$2), structural (CF-to-PC synapses), physiological (cerebellar oscillations), and behavioral levels (kinetic tremor) that might have clinical applications for treating ET.},

DESIGN: Randomized single-blinded controlled, feasibility study comparing aerobic training to no training.
SETTING: Home intervention, assessments conducted at an academic medical center.
SUBJECTS: Twenty individuals with cerebellar degeneration caused by a range of genetic disorders.
INTERVENTION: Aerobic training consisted of four weeks of stationary bicycle training, five times per week for 30-minute sessions. Intensity ranged from 65\% to 80\% of the participant's maximal heart rate determined during cardiopulmonary exercise testing.
MAIN MEASURES: Primary outcome measure was change in the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia scores. Recruitment rate, adherence, drop-out, and adverse events were also determined. The treatment was considered technically feasible if participants achieved target training frequency, duration, and intensity.
RESULTS: The 20 participants mean age was 50 years (standard deviation 15.65 years) and average Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia score was 9.6 (standard deviation 3.13). Ten participants were randomized to aerobic training and 10 to no training. Seven participants in the aerobic group attained target training duration, frequency, and intensity. There was a mean reduction in ataxia severity of 2.1 points (standard deviation 1.26) with four weeks of aerobic training, whereas ataxia severity increased by 0.3 (standard deviation 0.62) in the control group over the same period.

However, how ethnicity contributes to the clinical symptoms and disease progressions in monogenetic disorders, such as spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), remains less studied.
METHODS: We used multivariable linear and logistical regression models in 257 molecularly-confirmed SCA3 patients (66 Caucasians, 43 African Americans, and 148 Asians [composed of 131 Chinese and 17 Asian Americans]) to explore the influence of ethnicity on age at onset (AAO), ataxia severity, and non-ataxia symptoms (i.e. depression, tremor, and dystonia).
RESULTS: We found that Asians had significantly later AAO, compared to Caucasians ($\beta$~=~4.75, p~=~0.000) and to African Americans ($\beta$~=~6.64, p~=~0.000) after adjusting for the pathological CAG repeat numbers in ATXN3. African Americans exhibited the most severe ataxia as compared to Caucasians ($\beta$~=~3.81, p~=~0.004) and Asians ($\beta$~=~4.39, p~=~0.001) after taking into consideration of the pathological CAG repeat numbers in ATXN3 and disease duration. Caucasians had a higher prevalence of depression than African Americans ($\beta$~=~1.23, p~=~0.040). Ethnicity had no influence on tremor or dystonia.
CONCLUSIONS: Ethnicity plays an important role in clinical presentations of SCA3 patients, which could merit further clinical studies and public health consideration. These results highlight the role of ethnicity in monogenetic, neurodegenerative disorders.},

In the present study, MPTP-induced PD model was established to explore the neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effect of NBP. We assessed motor deficits, dopaminergic neurodegeneration and microglial activation in PD mice. In vitro, the anti-inflammatory activity of NBP was confirmed by cell viability assay of SH-SY5Y cells after being treated with conditioned medium from LPS-stimulated BV-2 cells and from 1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium iodide (MPP+)-stimulated BV-2 cells. The expression of pro-inflammatory molecules was determined by RT-PCR, Western Blot and ELISA assay. The generation of NO and ROS were also assessed. The involvement of signaling pathways such as MAPK, NF-$\kappa$B, and PI3k/Akt were further investigated by Western Blot and immunofluorescence assay. The neuroprotective effect of NBP was demonstrated in vivo as shown by the improvement of dopaminergic neurodegeneration, motor deficits and microglial activation in MPTP-induced mouse model of PD. The expression of pro-inflammatory mediators was also reduced by NBP administration. In vitro, NBP also protected dopaminergic neurons from neurotoxicity induced by activated microglia. NBP pretreatment not only reduced pro-inflammatory molecules, but also suppressed NO release and ROS generation in BV-2 cells. Further mechanism research suggested that the inactivation of MAPK, NF-$\kappa$B and PI3K/Akt may involve in anti-neuroinflammation role of NBP. In conclusion, our results revealed that NBP exerted dopaminergic neuroprotection through inhibition of microglia-mediated neuroinflammation, suggesting the promising therapeutic effect of NBP for PD.},

However, the integrity of cerebellum does not seem to be critical in managing sudden and unexpected environmental changes such as disturbances during walking. The cerebellum also plays a functional role in motor learning. Only a few effective therapies exist for individuals with cerebellar ataxia. With these in mind, we aimed at investigating: (1) corrective response of participants with cerebellar ataxia (CA) to unexpected gait perturbations; and (2) the effectiveness of a perturbation-based training to improve their dynamic stability during balance recovery responses and steady walking. Specifically, we hypothesized that: (1) CA group can show a corrective behavior similar to that of a healthy control group; (2) the exposure to a perturbation-based treatment can exploit residual learning capability, thus improving their dynamic stability during balance recovery responses and steady locomotion.
METHODS: Ten participants with cerebellar ataxia and eight age-matched healthy adults were exposed to a single perturbation-based training session. The Active Tethered Pelvic Assist Device applied unexpected waist-pull perturbations while participants walked on a treadmill. Spatio-temporal parameters and dynamic stability were determined during corrective responses and steady locomotion, before and after the training. The ANalysis Of VAriance was the main statistical test used to assess the effects of group (healthy vs CA) and training (baseline vs post) on spatio-temporal parameters of the gait and margin of stability.
RESULTS: Data analysis revealed that individuals with cerebellar ataxia behaved differently from healthy volunteers: (1) they retained a wider base of support during corrective responses and steady gait both before and after the training; (2) due to the training, patients improved their anterior-posterior margin of stability during steady walking only.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results revealed that participants with cerebellar ataxia could still rely on their learning capability to modify the gait towards a safer behavior. However, they could not take advantage from their residual learning capability while managing sudden and unexpected perturbations. Accordingly, the proposed training paradigm can be considered as a promising approach to improve balance control during steady walking in these individuals.},

	abstract = {Glucocerebrosidase (GCase, deficient in Gaucher disease) enzymatic activity measured in dried blood spots of Parkinson's Disease (PD) cases is within healthy range but reduced compared to controls. It is not known whether activities of additional lysosomal enzymes are reduced in dried blood spots in PD. To test whether reduction in lysosomal enzymatic activity in PD is specific to GCase, we measured GCase, acid sphingomyelinase (deficient in Niemann-Pick disease types A and B), alpha galactosidase A (deficient in Fabry), acid alpha-glucosidase (deficient in Pompe) and galactosylceramidase (deficient in Krabbe) enzymatic activities in dried blood spots of PD patients (n = 648) and controls (n = 317) recruited from Columbia University. Full sequencing of glucocerebrosidase (GBA) and the LRRK2 G2019S mutation was performed. Enzymatic activities were compared between PD cases and controls using t-test and regression models adjusted for age, gender, and GBA and LRRK2 G2019S mutation status. Alpha galactosidase A activity was lower in PD cases compared to controls both when only non-carriers were included (excluding all GBA and LRRK2 G2019S carriers and PD cases with age-at-onset below 40) [2.85 $\mu$mol/l/h versus 3.12 $\mu$mol/l/h, p = 0.018; after controlling for batch effect, p = 0.006 (468 PD cases and 296 controls)], and when including the entire cohort (2.89 $\mu$mol/l/h versus 3.10 $\mu$mol/l/h, p = 0.040; after controlling for batch effect, p = 0.011). Because the alpha galactosidase A gene is X-linked, we stratified the analyses by sex. Among women who were non-carriers of GBA and LRRK2 G2019S mutations (PD, n = 155; control, n = 194), alpha galactosidase A activity was lower in PD compared to controls (2.77 $\mu$mol/l/h versus 3.10 $\mu$mol/l/h, p = 0.044; after controlling for a batch effect, p = 0.001). The enzymatic activity of acid sphingomyelinase, acid alpha-glucosidase and galactosylceramidase was not significantly different between PD and controls. In non-carriers, most lysosomal enzyme activities were correlated, with the strongest association in GCase, acid alpha-glucosidase, and alpha galactosidase A (Pearson correlation coefficient between 0.382 and 0.532). In a regression model with all five enzymes among non-carriers (adjusted for sex and age), higher alpha galactosidase A activity was associated with lower odds of PD status (OR = 0.54; 95\% CI:0.31-0.95; p = 0.032). When LRRK2 G2019S PD carriers (n = 37) were compared to non-carriers with PD, carriers had higher GCase, acid sphingomyelinase and alpha galactosidase A activity. We conclude that alpha galactosidase A may have a potential independent role in PD, in addition to GCase.},

If the cerebellar degenerative pathology can directly drive tremor, one would hypothesize that tremor is likely to occur in the diseases of cerebellar ataxia and follows the disease progression in such disorders. To further test this hypothesis, we studied the occurrence of tremor in different disease stages of classical cerebellar degenerative disorders: spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs). We further separately analyzed postural tremor and rest tremor, two forms of tremor that both involve the cerebellum. We also explored tremor in different subtypes of SCAs. We found that 18.1\% of SCA patients have tremor. Interestingly, SCA patients with tremor have worse ataxia than those without tremor. When stratifying patients into mild, moderate, and severe disease stages according to the severity of ataxia, moderate and severe SCA patients more commonly have tremor than those with mild ataxia, the effect most prominently observed in postural tremor of SCA3 and SCA6 patients. Finally, tremor can independently contribute to worse functional status in SCA2 patients, even after adjusting for ataxia severity. Tremor is more likely to occur in the severe stage of cerebellar degeneration when compared to mild stages. Our results partially support the cerebellar degenerative model of tremor.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prevalence of Restless legs syndrome (RLS) in End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) patients is higher than that in the general population. However, the associations of RLS within the ESRD population are inconsistent and RLS is usually neglected in dialysis centers, although it impairs the life quality among ESRD patients. We aim to investigate the prevalence of RLS in patients with ESRD undergoing maintenance hemodialysis and evaluate the risk factors of developing RLS and the effect of RLS on quality of life among ESRD patients.
METHODS: ESRD patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis in Shanghai General Hospital dialysis unit from July 2016 to October 2016 were enrolled in the study. RLS was diagnosed according to the criteria of the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG). IRLSSG Severity Scale was used to evaluate the severity of RLS. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to evaluate sleep quality, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to estimate anxiety and depression. Serologic and historic variables were analyzed to determine predictors of RLS in the ESRD population.
RESULTS: A total of 137 ESRD patients were enrolled. The prevalence of RLS among the ESRD patients was 20.44\%. The risk of RLS was increased significantly in females (OR = 2.729, p = 0.032) and daily alcohol drinkers (OR = 4.716, p = 0.022). RLS increased the risks of sleep disorders (25/28, 89.3\% vs 73/109, 67.0\%, p = 0.02) and sedative hypnotics intake (7/28, 25.0\% vs 10/109, 9.2\%, p = 0.047) and impaired the sleep quality (7/109 vs 11/28, p = 0.001) according to PSQI sum scores.
CONCLUSION: A high RLS prevalence among the ESRD patients undergoing hemodialysis was confirmed. ESRD patients who are women and drinking alcohol have a higher risk of RLS. The sleep quality was significantly impaired and sleeping medication use was more common among the ESRD patients with RLS.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: SMPD1 (acid-sphingomyelinase) variants have been associated with Parkinson's disease in recent studies. The objective of this study was to further investigate the role of SMPD1 mutations in PD.
METHODS: SMPD1 was sequenced in 3 cohorts (Israel Ashkenazi Jewish cohort, Montreal/Montpellier, and New York), including 1592 PD patients and 975 controls. Additional data were available for 10,709 Ashkenazi Jewish controls. Acid-sphingomyelinase activity was measured by a mass spectrometry-based assay in the New York cohort. $\alpha$-Synuclein levels were measured in vitro following CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout and siRNA knockdown of SMPD1 in HeLa and BE(2)-M17 cells. Lysosomal localization of acid-sphingomyelinase with different mutations was studied, and in silico analysis of their effect on acid-sphingomyelinase structure was performed.
RESULTS: SMPD1 mutations were associated with PD in the Ashkenazi Jewish cohort, as 1.4\% of PD patients carried the p.L302P or p.fsP330 mutation, compared with 0.37\% in 10,709 Ashkenazi Jewish controls (OR, 3.7; 95\%CI, 1.6-8.2; P = 0.0025). In the Montreal/Montpellier cohort, the p.A487V variant was nominally associated with PD (1.5\% versus 0.14\%; P = 0.0065, not significant after correction for multiple comparisons). Among PD patients, reduced acid-sphingomyelinase activity was associated with a 3.5- to 5.8-year earlier onset of PD in the lowest quartile versus the highest quartile of acid-sphingomyelinase activity (P = 0.01-0.001). We further demonstrated that SMPD1 knockout and knockdown resulted in increased $\alpha$-synuclein levels in HeLa and BE(2)-M17 dopaminergic cells and that the p.L302P and p.fsP330 mutations impair the traffic of acid-sphingomyelinase to the lysosome.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results support an association between SMPD1 variants, acid-sphingomyelinase activity, and PD. Furthermore, they suggest that reduced acid-sphingomyelinase activity may lead to $\alpha$-synuclein accumulation. {\textcopyright} 2019 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.},

We report that N-terminal alternative splicing of PSD95 generates an isoform, PSD95beta that contains an additional "L27" motif, which is also present in SAP97. Using yeast two hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation assays, we demonstrate that this N-terminal L27 domain of PSD-95beta, binds to an L27 domain in the membrane-associated guanylate kinase calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine kinase, and to Hrs, an endosomal ATPase that regulates vesicular trafficking. By transfecting heterologous cells and hippocampal neurons, we find that interactions with the L27 domain regulate synaptic clustering of PSD95beta. Disrupting Hrs-regulated early endosomal sorting in hippocampal neurons selectively blocks synaptic clustering of PSD95beta but does not interfere with trafficking of the palmitoylated isoform, PSD95alpha. These studies identify molecular and functional heterogeneity in synaptic PSD95 complexes and reveal critical roles for L27 domain interactions and Hrs regulated vesicular trafficking in postsynaptic protein clustering.},

	abstract = {Regulation of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) at synapses plays a critical role in alterations of synaptic strength in the brain. Stargazin, an AMPAR-interacting protein, is critical for clustering and regulation of synaptic AMPARs. Stargazin interacts with AMPARs via its extracellular domain and with PDZ [postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95)/Discs large (Dlg)/zona occludens-1 (ZO-1)] proteins via its C-terminal PDZ-binding motif, and these interactions are necessary for stargazin and AMPAR synaptic targeting. By studying the expression of stargazin mutant constructs in cultured hippocampal neurons, we identified a novel domain corresponding to residues 243-283 within the cytoplasmic C terminus of stargazin that is also required for stargazin and AMPAR synaptic clustering. To identify proteins that interact with this stargazin synaptic clustering domain, we performed a yeast two-hybrid assay and found that this stargazin domain binds to nPIST (neuronal isoform of protein-interacting specifically with TC10), a Golgi-enriched protein implicated in trafficking of transmembrane proteins. Using in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, coimmunoprecipitation studies, and biochemical fractionation, we found that stargazin and nPIST colocalize and interact in the brain. Finally, by studying AMPAR clustering in transfected hippocampal neurons, we found that overexpression of nPIST enhances AMPAR synaptic clustering, whereas transfection of a dominant-negative nPIST construct attenuates AMPAR synaptic clustering. These studies identify a novel stargazin domain necessary for synaptic clustering of AMPARs and suggest that nPIST and stargazin interactions play a critical role in AMPAR trafficking to the synapse.},

Tourette's syndrome is the most common cause of tics, which are involuntary or semivoluntary, sudden, brief, intermittent, repetitive movements (motor tics) or sounds (phonic tics). It is often associated with psychiatric comorbidities, mainly attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Given its diverse presentation, Tourette's syndrome can mimic many hyperkinetic disorders, making the diagnosis challenging at times. The etiology of this syndrome is thought to be related to basal ganglia dysfunction. Treatment can be behavioral, pharmacologic, or surgical, and is dictated by the most incapacitating symptoms. Alpha2-adrenergic agonists are the first line of pharmacologic therapy, but dopamine-receptor-blocking drugs are required for multiple, complex tics. Dopamine-receptor-blocking drugs are associated with potential side effects including sedation, weight gain, acute dystonic reactions, and tardive dyskinesia. Appropriate diagnosis and treatment can substantially improve quality of life and psychosocial functioning in affected children.},

Cancer patients are at high risk of this acute encephalopathy due to chronic malnutrition, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, and consumption of thiamine by rapidly growing tumors. A high index of suspicion is important as these critically ill patients may not present with the classic triad of symptoms.
METHODS: This study is a retrospective review of 5 patients with WE identified at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Tex., USA. Detailed clinical histories, risk factors, imaging, and histopathological characteristics are described.
RESULTS: Five WE patients were identified and all patients had rapidly growing cancers and were undergoing active treatment. All patients had poor nutritional status due to chronic nausea from chemotherapy. Three patients received bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Acute confusion was the most common symptom. Magnetic resonance imaging studies of the brain revealed restricted diffusion and fluid attenuation inversion recovery sequence hyperintensity in the medial thalami and periaqueductal gray matter. In 2 cases, WE was considered antemortem, and only 1 was empirically treated with thiamine, which rapidly reversed the imaging findings within 7 days and led to clinical improvement. Other cases were diagnosed at autopsy.
CONCLUSION: It is crucial to consider WE in the differential diagnosis for all cancer patients with confusion. Cancer patients with malnutrition and patients with BMT are at high risk of developing WE. To prevent this devastating and often fatal neurologic complication, all cancer patients with confusion should be empirically treated with thiamine.},

The use of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) in the management of acute ischemic stroke is the accepted standard of practice. Current guidelines for intravenous (IV) t-PA therapy in acute ischemic stroke do not exclude patients with infective endocarditis. We present three patients who received IV t-PA for acute ischemic stroke in the setting of infective endocarditis and developed multifocal intracranial hemorrhage as a complication.
CONCLUSION: Infective endocarditis related strokes are associated with a higher risk of hemorrhagic complications and our experience suggests that IV t-PA use may potentiate that risk.},

METHODS: Charts of subjects whose conditions were diagnosed as tic disorders seen at our clinic from 2003 to 2007 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients who met diagnostic criteria for TS and were started on topiramate at our clinic with at least 1 follow-up visit after beginning topiramate were included. The efficacy of topiramate on a subjective scale, the global impression of response (0 = no response/worse, 1 = mild improvement, 2 = moderate improvement, 3 = marked improvement), and adverse effects were recorded for analysis.
RESULTS: Of 453 subjects, 367 met diagnostic criteria for TS and 41 (11.1\%; 34 males) were treated with topiramate for tics for 9.43 +/- 7.03 months (range, 1-27 months). Mean age at onset of tics was 6.93 +/- 2.78 years (range, 2-14 years) and at start of topiramate treatment was 14.83 +/- 5.63 years (range, 9-27 years). The average efficacy on tics was 2.15 +/- 1.11, and 75.6\% (n = 31) of subjects had moderate to marked improvement and adverse effects included cognitive/language problems (24.4\%, n = 10) and aggression or mood swings (9.8\%, n = 4).
CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective chart review suggests that topiramate can be used for tics in TS with at least moderate efficacy and typical adverse effects. Randomized controlled trials are needed.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Recent postmortem studies reveal degenerative changes, including Purkinje cell (PC) loss, in most brains from individuals with essential tremor (ET). Heterotopic PCs (HPCs) (ie, PC bodies displaced into the molecular layer) may be found in neurodegenerative diseases with PC loss. HPCs have been observed in ET but no quantitative case control analysis has been performed.
METHODS: HPCs were counted in 35 ET brains and 32 control brains (including 21 non-diseased controls and 11 diseased controls with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)) using a standard 20 {\texttimes} 25 mm cerebellar cortical section stained with a modified Bielscholwsky method.
RESULTS: The median number of HPCs per section was three times higher in 35 ET cases (median 3, mean {\textpm} SD 3.8 {\textpm} 3.6, range 0-14) versus 32 controls (median 1, mean {\textpm} SD 1.6 {\textpm} 1.7, range 0-5) (p = 0.007). The number of HPCs was similarly low in the 21 non-diseased controls and 12 PSP brains (median 1 in each group) (p = 0.04 and p = 0.01 compared with ET). In ET, the number of HPCs was inversely related to the number of PCs (Spearman's rho -0.36, p = 0.038) (ie, cases with more HPCs had fewer PCs).
CONCLUSION: PC heterotopia, which occurs in cerebellar degenerative disorders, is also a feature of ET. These findings further contribute to our understanding of the postmortem changes in this common neurological disease.},

A brief 9-symptom WO questionnaire (WOQ-9) was recently found to be highly sensitive in its detection. We aimed to validate a Chinese version WOQ-9 (CWOQ-9) among Chinese patients with PD.
METHODS: We recruited 101 literate Chinese PD patients among 4 different neurology or movement disorders clinics in Hong Kong to participate in this study by completing the CWOQ-9. Clinical judgment by the specialists was considered the gold standard for diagnosing WO.
RESULTS: The mean age ({\textpm}SD) of the patients was 61 ({\textpm}9) years and 35 (34.7\%) of them were female. The disease duration was 7.4 ({\textpm}5.4) years and 69 (68.3\%) of them were diagnosed clinically to have WO by the specialists. The positive and negative predictive values, sensitivity and specificity of CWOQ-9 were 86\%, 71\%, 87\%, and 69\% respectively. The area under curve (AUC) was 0.78 (p{\textless}0.001).

We analyzed microtubule-associated protein light chain 3-II (LC3-II), S6K, phosphorylated S6K, beclin-1, and mitochondrial membrane proteins levels by Western blot in the post-mortem cerebellum of 10 ET cases and 11 controls. We also performed immunohistochemistry in 12 ET cases and 13 controls to quantify LC3 clustering in Purkinje cells (PCs). LC3-II protein levels were significantly lower in ET cases vs. controls on Western blot (0.84 {\textpm} 0.14 vs. 1.00 {\textpm} 0.14, p = 0.02), and LC3-II clustering in PCs by immunohistochemistry was significantly lower in ET cases vs. controls (2.03 {\textpm} 3.45 vs. 8.80 {\textpm} 9.81, p = 0.03). In ET cases, disease duration was inversely correlated with LC3-II protein level (r = -0.64, p = 0.046).

Decreased macroautophagy was observed in the ET cerebellum, and this could be due to a decrease in beclin-1 levels, which subsequently lead to mitochondrial accumulation as a result of autophagic failure.

Multiple lines of evidence implicate mitochondrial dysfunction in ASD. In postmortem BA21 temporal cortex, a region that exhibits synaptic pathology in ASD, we found that compared to controls, ASD patients exhibited altered protein levels of mitochondria respiratory chain protein complexes, decreased Complex I and IV activities, decreased mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme SOD2, and greater oxidative DNA damage. Mitochondrial membrane mass was higher in ASD brain, as indicated by higher protein levels of mitochondrial membrane proteins Tom20, Tim23 and porin. No differences were observed in either mitochondrial DNA or levels of the mitochondrial gene transcription factor TFAM or cofactor PGC1$\alpha$, indicating that a mechanism other than alterations in mitochondrial genome or mitochondrial biogenesis underlies these mitochondrial abnormalities. We further identified higher levels of the mitochondrial fission proteins (Fis1 and Drp1) and decreased levels of the fusion proteins (Mfn1, Mfn2 and Opa1) in ASD patients, indicating altered mitochondrial dynamics in ASD brain. Many of these changes were evident in cortical pyramidal neurons, and were observed in ASD children but were less pronounced or absent in adult patients. Together, these findings provide evidence that mitochondrial function and intracellular redox status are compromised in pyramidal neurons in ASD brain and that mitochondrial dysfunction occurs during early childhood when ASD symptoms appear.},

We found LRRK2 to be degraded in lysosomes by chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), whereas the most common pathogenic mutant form of LRRK2, G2019S, was poorly degraded by this pathway. In contrast to the behavior of typical CMA substrates, lysosomal binding of both wild-type and several pathogenic mutant LRRK2 proteins was enhanced in the presence of other CMA substrates, which interfered with the organization of the CMA translocation complex, resulting in defective CMA. Cells responded to such LRRK2-mediated CMA compromise by increasing levels of the CMA lysosomal receptor, as seen in neuronal cultures and brains of LRRK2 transgenic mice, induced pluripotent stem cell-derived dopaminergic neurons and brains of Parkinson's disease patients with LRRK2 mutations. This newly described LRRK2 self-perpetuating inhibitory effect on CMA could underlie toxicity in Parkinson's disease by compromising the degradation of $\alpha$-synuclein, another Parkinson's disease-related protein degraded by this pathway.},

	abstract = {The Lingo-1 sequence variant has been associated with essential tremor (ET) in several genome-wide association studies. However, the role that Lingo-1 might play in pathogenesis of ET is not understood. Since Lingo-1 protein is a negative regulator of axonal regeneration and neurite outgrowth, it could contribute to Purkinje cell (PC) or basket cell axonal pathology observed in postmortem studies of ET brains. In this study, we used Western blotting and immunohistochemistry to examine Lingo-1 protein in ET vs. control brains. In Western blots, Lingo-1 protein expression level was significantly increased in cerebellar cortex (1.56 {\textpm} 0.46 in ET cases vs. 0.99 {\textpm} 0.20 in controls, p = 0.002), but was similar in the occipital cortex (p = 1.00) of ET cases vs. controls. Lingo-1 immunohistochemistry in cerebellum revealed that Lingo-1 was enriched in the distal axonal processes of basket cells, which formed a "pinceau" structure around the PC axon initial segment (AIS). We found that some Lingo-1-positive pinceau had abnormally elongated processes, targeting PC axon segments distal to the AIS. In ET cases, the percentage of Lingo-1-positive pinceau that were >=30 or >=40 $\mu$m in length was increased 2.4- to 4.1-fold, respectively, vs. pinceau seen in control brains (p {\textless} 0.0001). Elongated Lingo-1-positive pinceau strongly correlated with number of PC axonal torpedoes and a rating of basket cell axonal pathology. The increased cerebellar Lingo-1 expression and elongated Lingo-1-positive pinceau processes could contribute to the abnormal PC and basket cell axonal pathology and cerebellar dysfunction observed in ET.},

METHODS: To characterize the clinical manifestations of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) 1, 2, 3 and 6 and their natural histories in the United States (US), we conducted a prospective multicenter study utilized a protocol identical to the European consortium study, using the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) score as the primary outcome, with follow-ups every 6 months up to 2 years.
RESULTS: We enrolled 345 patients (60 SCA1, 75 SCA2, 138 SCA3 and 72 SCA6) at 12 US centers. SCA6 patients had a significantly later onset, and SCA2 patients showed greater upper-body ataxia than patients with the remaining SCAs. The annual increase of SARA score was greater in SCA1 patients (mean {\textpm} SE: 1.61 {\textpm} 0.41) than in SCA2 (0.71 {\textpm} 0.31), SCA3 (0.65 {\textpm} 0.24) and SCA6 (0.87 {\textpm} 0.28) patients (p = 0.049). The functional stage also worsened faster in SCA1 than in SCA2, 3 and 6 (p = 0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: The proportions of different SCA patients in US differ from those in the European consortium study, but as in the European patients, SCA1 progress faster than those with SCA2, 3 and 6. Later onset in SCA6 and greater upper body ataxia in SCA2 were noted. We conclude that progression rates of these SCAs were comparable between US and Europe cohorts, suggesting the feasibility of international collaborative clinical studies.},

Alterations in 17 metabolites were detected in mature and aged mice compared to young mice (13 decreased and 4 increased metabolites), including metabolites related to dysfunctional lipid metabolism (significantly increased cholesterol, oleic acid, and phosphoglyceride levels), decreased amino acid (alanine, serine, glycine, aspartic acid, glutamate, and gamma-aminobutyric acid), and energy-related metabolite levels (malic acid, butanedioic acid, fumaric acid, and citric acid), and other altered metabolites (increased N-acetyl-aspartic acid and decreased pyroglutamic acid, urea, and lactic acid) in the hippocampus. All of these alterations indicated that the metabolic mechanisms of age-related cognitive impairment in SAMP8 mice were related to multiple pathways and networks.

RESULTS: Action and postural tremor in the mouse began 5 minutes after subcutaneous harmaline injection and peaked at approximately 30 minutes. The tremor involved the head, trunk, tail, and four limbs and lasted for approximately 2 hours. The forelimb tremor was postural or action tremor, similar to that observed in ET.
DISCUSSION: This video segment provides the first visual documentation of the phenomenology of harmaline-induced tremor in a mouse. We also raise several unanswered questions regarding the use of harmaline-induced tremor to model ET.},

We have reported that the polymorphisms of a clock-related gene, Tef, contributed to the risk of sleep disturbances and depression in the Parkinson disease. The objective of the present study was to examine whether the three clock genes we previously studied are associated with major depressive disorder (MDD) in the Chinese population.
METHODS: 105 Subjects with MDD and 485 control subjects participated in this case-control study. Demographics, Mini-mental Status Examination (MMSE), and the Hamilton rating scale for depression (HAMD) were obtained in all subjects. Genotypes of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of Cry1 rs2287161, Cry2 rs10838524 and Tef rs738499 were screened by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP).
RESULTS: MDD cases had a significantly higher frequency carrying the C allele and CC genotype in Cry1 rs2287161 and the T allele and TT genotype in Tef rs738499 than controls.
LIMITATIONS: The sample size of MDD group was relatively small.

	abstract = {Torpedo formation and Purkinje cell (PC) loss represent standard and inter-related cerebellar responses to injury. Surprisingly, the nature of their relationship has not been carefully characterized across a range of normal and disease states. Are brains with more torpedoes expected to have fewer PCs? We quantified torpedoes and PCs in four groups: essential tremor (ET), spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), multiple system atrophy-cerebellar (MSA-C), and controls. Brains from 100 individuals (58 ET, 27 controls, 7 SCA, 8 MSA-C) were available at the New York Brain Bank. After complete neuropathological assessment, a standard parasagittal neocerebellar block was harvested; a 7-$\mu$m thick section was stained with Luxol fast blue/hematoxylin and eosin; and torpedoes and PCs were quantified. For a given PC count, SCA and MSA-C cases often had higher torpedo counts than ET cases or controls. Furthermore, the relationship between torpedo and PC counts was complex. The correlation between torpedo and PC counts was negative in ET cases (i.e., individuals with more torpedoes had fewer PCs [i.e., more PC loss]) whereas the relationship was positive in MSA-C cases (i.e., individuals with fewer PCs [i.e., more PC loss] had fewer torpedoes). Patients with SCA showed both patterns. When all diagnostic groups were combined, the correlation was best fit by a quadratic (i.e., parabolic) model rather than a simple linear model; this model incorporated data on the negative correlation in ET cases, the mixed results in SCA cases, and the positive correlation in MSA-C cases (r = 0.636). The relationship between torpedo and PC counts was complex and heterogeneous across a range of cerebellar disease states, and was best characterized by a quadratic rather than a simple model. With more severe cerebellar disease, torpedoes can be quite numerous and are likely a common feature of surviving PCs, but eventually, dramatic loss of PC leads to a paradoxical reduction in observable torpedoes.},

Although the size of the expansion is negatively correlated with age at onset, it accounts for only 50-70\% of its variability. To find other factors involved in this variability, we performed a regression analysis in 1255 affected individuals with identified expansions (spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7), recruited through the European Consortium on Spinocerebellar Ataxias, to determine whether age at onset is influenced by the size of the normal allele in eight causal (CAG)n-containing genes (ATXN1-3, 6-7, 17, ATN1 and HTT). We confirmed the negative effect of the expanded allele and detected threshold effects reflected by a quadratic association between age at onset and CAG size in spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 3 and 6. We also evidenced an interaction between the expanded and normal alleles in trans in individuals with spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 6 and 7. Except for individuals with spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, age at onset was also influenced by other (CAG)n-containing genes: ATXN7 in spinocerebellar ataxia type 2; ATXN2, ATN1 and HTT in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3; ATXN1 and ATXN3 in spinocerebellar ataxia type 6; and ATXN3 and TBP in spinocerebellar ataxia type 7. This suggests that there are biological relationships among these genes. The results were partially replicated in four independent populations representing 460 Caucasians and 216 Asian samples; the differences are possibly explained by ethnic or geographical differences. As the variability in age at onset is not completely explained by the effects of the causative and modifier sister genes, other genetic or environmental factors must also play a role in these diseases.},

METHODS: A standard neocerebellar tissue block was stained with Luxol fast blue Hematoxylin \& Eosin. Within 5 selected fields, cell soma (e.g., stellate, basket, and glial cell bodies) were counted. Cellular density was the number of cells/cm(2).
RESULTS: The Purkinje cell count differed across the three groups (p~{\textless}~0.001), with the highest counts in controls, intermediate counts in ET cases and lowest counts in SCA cases. ET cases and controls had similar molecular layer cellular density (p~=~0.79) but SCA cases had higher values than both groups (p~{\textless}~0.01). A robust inverse correlation between Purkinje cell count and molecular layer cellular density (i.e., brains with more Purkinje cell loss had higher molecular layer cellular density), observed in SCA and controls (r~=~-0.55, p~=~0.008), was not observed in ET cases.
DISCUSSION: Although Purkinje cell counts were reduced in ET cases compared to controls, an increase in molecular layer cellular density was not evident in ET. The increase in molecular layer cellular density, observed in SCA cases, may require a more marked loss of PCs than occurs in ET.},

	abstract = {Structural changes in Purkinje cells have been identified in the essential tremor cerebellum, although the mechanisms that underlie these changes remain poorly understood. Climbing fibres provide one of the major excitatory inputs to Purkinje cells, and climbing fibre-Purkinje cell connections are essential for normal cerebellar-mediated motor control. The distribution of climbing fibre-Purkinje cell synapses on Purkinje cell dendrites is dynamically regulated and may be altered in disease states. The aim of the present study was to examine the density and distribution of climbing fibre-Purkinje cell synapses using post-mortem cerebellar tissue of essential tremor cases and controls. Using vesicular glutamate transporter type 2 immunohistochemistry, we labelled climbing fibre-Purkinje cell synapses of 12 essential tremor cases and 13 age-matched controls from the New York Brain Bank. Normally, climbing fibres form synapses mainly on the thick, proximal Purkinje cell dendrites in the inner portion of the molecular layer, whereas parallel fibres form synapses on the thin, distal Purkinje cell spiny branchlets. We observed that, compared with controls, essential tremor cases had decreased climbing fibre-Purkinje cell synaptic density, more climbing fibres extending to the outer portion of the molecular layer, and more climbing fibre-Purkinje cell synapses on the thin Purkinje cell spiny branchlets. Interestingly, in essential tremor, the increased distribution of climbing fibre-Purkinje cell synapses on the thin Purkinje cell branchlets was inversely associated with clinical tremor severity, indicating a close relationship between the altered distribution of climbing fibre-Purkinje cell connections and tremor. These findings suggest that abnormal climbing fibre-Purkinje cell connections could be of importance in the pathogenesis of essential tremor.},

	abstract = {Genetic polymorphisms in Solute carrier family 1 (glial high affinity glutamate transporter), member 2 (SLC1A2) have been linked with essential tremor. SLC1A2 encodes excitatory amino acid transporter type 2 (EAAT2), which clears glutamate from the synaptic cleft. One postulated mechanism for essential tremor is the over-excitation of glutamatergic olivo-cerebellar climbing fibers, leading to excitotoxic death of Purkinje cells. Other glutamatergic excitatory signals are transmitted to Purkinje cells via parallel fibers of cerebellar granule neurons. Therefore, the expression level of glutamate transporters could be important in essential tremor pathogenesis. Using Western blotting, we compared the expression levels of the two main glutamate transporters in the cerebellar cortex, EAAT1 and EAAT2, in postmortem tissue from 16 essential tremor cases and 13 age-matched controls. We also studied the localization of EAAT1 and EAAT2 using immunohistochemistry in 10 essential tremor cases and 12 controls. EAAT1 protein levels were similar in cases and controls (1.12 {\textpm} 0.83 vs. 1.01 {\textpm} 0.69, p =0.71) whereas EAAT2 protein levels in essential tremor cases were only 1/3 of that in controls (0.35 {\textpm} 0.23 vs. 1.00 {\textpm} 0.62, p {\textless} 0.01). Interestingly, EAAT2, but not EAAT1, was expressed in astrocytic processes surrounding the Purkinje cell axon initial segment, a region of previously observed pathological changes in essential tremor. Our main finding, a significant reduction in cerebellar cortical EAAT2 protein levels in essential tremor, suggests that Purkinje cells in essential tremor might be more vulnerable to excitotoxic damage than those of controls.},

The contributions of vascular risk factors to spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) are not known.

Methods
We studied 319 participants with SCA 1, 2, 3, and 6 and repeatedly measured clinical severity using the Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) for 2 years. Vascular risk factors were summarized by CHA2DS2-VASc scores as the vascular risk factor index. We employed regression models to study the effects of vascular risk factors on ataxia onset and progression after adjusting for age, sex, and pathological CAG repeats. Our secondary analyses took hyperlipidemia into account.

Results
Nearly 60\% of SCA participants were at low vascular risks with CHA2DS2-VASc?=?0, and 31\% scored 2 or greater. Higher CHA2DS2-VASc scores were not associated with either earlier onset or faster progression of ataxia. These findings were not altered after accounting for hyperlipidemia.

Discussion
Vascular risks are not common in SCAs and are not associated with earlier onset or faster ataxia progression.},

In this study, we identified 110 patients who are diagnosed with idiopathic PD and recruited them for assessing information about their PD related motor and nonmotor symptoms and rating scales. A follow-up evaluation was performed in 103 patients 30 months later. About 66.7\% depressed patients at baseline were still depressed at follow-up, and 24.4\% had incident depression among subjects without depression at baseline. Greater decline on MMSE (P = 0.029), higher baseline UPDRS-II (P {\textless} 0.001) score, change of UPDRS-II (P = 0.026), and female (P {\textless} 0.001) were associated with the worsening of HDRS scores. Higher baseline HDRS score (P {\textless} 0.001) and greater decline on MMSE (P = 0.001) were related to the occurrence of depression. In conclusion, cognitive decline is a disease related factor of worsening and the occurrence of depression. Activities of Daily Living (ADL) symptoms in PD and female gender may be crucial factors of increasing depressive symptoms.},

AIMS: Here we compared the clinical features of PSP and MSA to gain insight into their diagnosis and prognosis, particularly the prognostic value of down-gaze palsy latency in PSP progression.
METHODS: We reviewed clinical features of pathologically confirmed 10 PSP and 13 MSA patients, incidentally matched in age-at-onset, gender, and disease duration, followed at Columbia University Medical Center during 1994-2009.
RESULTS: The final antemortem diagnosis was incorrect in 30\% of PSP (all lacking down-gaze palsy) and 23\% of MSA patients. Falls in the first year of the disease, pyramidal involvement and freezing of gait during the course were similar between PSP and MSA. Ataxia and apraxia were in 50\% of the PSP patients. Parkinsonism responsive to levodopa treatment was in 30\% of the PSP (all with resting tremor) and 50\% of the MSA patients. Dysautonomia in MSA could occur as early as 3 years preceding the motor symptoms, with 46\% within the first year of the motor onset, but 15\% did not have dysautonomia in life. The latency of down-gaze palsy and urogenital dysfunction and MMSE scores at first visit in PSP, and the latency of falls and wheelchair confinement in MSA were all associated with the disease progression.
CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed most of the previously published characterizations, and identified for the first time the prognostic value of down-gaze palsy latency in PSP progression.},

	abstract = {Glucocerebrosidase (GBA) mutations have been associated with Parkinson's disease in numerous studies. However, it is unknown whether the increased risk of Parkinson's disease in GBA carriers is due to a loss of glucocerebrosidase enzymatic activity. We measured glucocerebrosidase enzymatic activity in dried blood spots in patients with Parkinson's disease (n = 517) and controls (n = 252) with and without GBA mutations. Participants were recruited from Columbia University, New York, and fully sequenced for GBA mutations and genotyped for the LRRK2 G2019S mutation, the most common autosomal dominant mutation in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. Glucocerebrosidase enzymatic activity in dried blood spots was measured by a mass spectrometry-based assay and compared among participants categorized by GBA mutation status and Parkinson's disease diagnosis. Parkinson's disease patients were more likely than controls to carry the LRRK2 G2019S mutation (n = 39, 7.5\% versus n = 2, 0.8\%, P {\textless} 0.001) and GBA mutations or variants (seven homozygotes and compound heterozygotes and 81 heterozygotes, 17.0\% versus 17 heterozygotes, 6.7\%, P {\textless} 0.001). GBA homozygotes/compound heterozygotes had lower enzymatic activity than GBA heterozygotes (0.85 {\textmu}mol/l/h versus 7.88 {\textmu}mol/l/h, P {\textless} 0.001), and GBA heterozygotes had lower enzymatic activity than GBA and LRRK2 non-carriers (7.88 {\textmu}mol/l/h versus 11.93 {\textmu}mol/l/h, P {\textless} 0.001). Glucocerebrosidase activity was reduced in heterozygotes compared to non-carriers when each mutation was compared independently (N370S, P {\textless} 0.001; L444P, P {\textless} 0.001; 84GG, P = 0.003; R496H, P = 0.018) and also reduced in GBA variants associated with Parkinson's risk but not with Gaucher disease (E326K, P = 0.009; T369M, P {\textless} 0.001). When all patients with Parkinson's disease were considered, they had lower mean glucocerebrosidase enzymatic activity than controls (11.14 {\textmu}mol/l/h versus 11.85 {\textmu}mol/l/h, P = 0.011). Difference compared to controls persisted in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (after exclusion of all GBA and LRRK2 carriers; 11.53 {\textmu}mol/l/h, versus 12.11 {\textmu}mol/l/h, P = 0.036) and after adjustment for age and gender (P = 0.012). Interestingly, LRRK2 G2019S carriers (n = 36), most of whom had Parkinson's disease, had higher enzymatic activity than non-carriers (13.69 {\textmu}mol/l/h versus 11.93 {\textmu}mol/l/h, P = 0.002). In patients with idiopathic Parkinson's, higher glucocerebrosidase enzymatic activity was associated with longer disease duration (P = 0.002) in adjusted models, suggesting a milder disease course. We conclude that lower glucocerebrosidase enzymatic activity is strongly associated with GBA mutations, and modestly with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. The association of lower glucocerebrosidase activity in both GBA mutation carriers and Parkinson's patients without GBA mutations suggests that loss of glucocerebrosidase function contributes to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. High glucocerebrosidase enzymatic activity in LRRK2 G2019S carriers may reflect a distinct pathogenic mechanism. Taken together, these data suggest that glucocerebrosidase enzymatic activity could be a modifiable therapeutic target.},

We now analyze the regularity of distribution of Purkinje cells along the Purkinje cell layer to determine whether there is greater disorganization in ET cases than in age-matched controls. A standard parasagittal, formalin-fixed, tissue block was harvested from the neocerebellum of 50 ET cases and 25 age-matched controls. The gap length distance ($\mu$m) between Purkinje cells was quantified using a nearest neighbor analysis in which the distance between each Purkinje cell body was measured in OpenLAB software, version 5 (Improvision, Waltham, MA) by drawing a freehand line between adjacent Purkinje cell bodies along the entirety of the Purkinje cell layer within a given image. We analyzed the subject-specific variation in the organization of Purkinje cells along the Purkinje cell layer. The 50 ET cases and 25 controls were similar in age at death, gender, and brain weight. Overall, greater variation in gap length distance (i.e., more disorganization) was associated with greater gap length distance (p {\textless} 0.001) and younger age (p = 0.020). However, the variation in the Purkinje cell gap length distance (i.e., Purkinje cell organization) did not differ in ET cases and controls (p = 0.330). We observed that the regularity of the distribution of Purkinje cells along the Purkinje cell layer did not differ between ET cases and controls. Several alternative biological interpretations for this finding are discussed.},

METHODS: We studied 300 participants with SCA 1, 2, 3 and 6 from the Clinical Research Consortium for Spinocerebellar Ataxias (CRC-SCA) and repeatedly measured depressive symptoms by the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) along with other clinical features including ataxia, functional status, and quality of life every 6 months for 2 years. We employed regression models to study the effects of depressive symptoms on clinical progression indexed by Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA), Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale Part IV (UHDRS-IV) and EQ5D after adjusting for age, sex and pathological CAG repeats.
RESULTS: Comorbid depression is common in SCAs (26\%). Although the baseline prevalence of depression was similar among different SCA types, suicidal ideation was more frequently reported in SCA3 (65\%). Depressive symptoms were associated with SARA scores but did not significantly progress over time within 2 years or deteriorate by increased numbers of pathological CAG repeats. The effects of depression on ataxia progression varied across different SCA types. Nevertheless, depression had consistently negative and significant impact on functional status and quality of life in all SCAs, even after accounting for ataxia progression.
CONCLUSIONS: Depressive symptoms are not simply the consequence of motor disability in SCAs. Comorbid depression per se contributes to different health outcomes and deserves more attention when caring patients with SCAs.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Essential tremor is one of the most common movement disorders in the world, with prevalence in the general population of 0.4\% to 3.9\%.
METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic overview, aiming to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of drug treatments in people with essential tremor of the hand? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to January 2014 (Clinical Evidence overviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this overview).
RESULTS: At this update, searching of electronic databases retrieved 56 studies. After deduplication and removal of conference abstracts, 31 records were screened for inclusion in the overview. Appraisal of titles and abstracts led to the exclusion of 18 studies and the further review of 13 full publications. Of the 13 full articles evaluated, two RCTs were added at this update. We performed a GRADE evaluation for 11 PICO combinations.
CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic overview, we categorised the efficacy for 13 interventions based on information about the effectiveness and safety of alprazolam, beta-blockers other than propranolol, botulinum A toxin-haemagglutinin complex, clonazepam, diazepam, gabapentin, levetiracetam, lorazepam, phenobarbital, primidone, propranolol, sodium oxybate, and topiramate.},

However, their mechanisms and their relationship still require further study. In the present study, we focused on the change and relationship of SIRT1 and HIF-1$\alpha$ in PD. PD cell models were established by using methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+)), which induced inhibition of cell proliferation, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. We found that the expression of HIF-1$\alpha$ and its target genes VEGFA and LDHA increased and that SIRT1 expression was inhibited in MPP(+) treated cells. With further analysis, we found that the acetylation of H3K14 combined with the HIF-1$\alpha$ promoter was dramatically increased in cells treated with MPP(+), which resulted in the transcriptional activation of HIF-1$\alpha$. Moreover, the acetylation of H3K14 and the expression of HIF-1$\alpha$ increased when SIRT1 was knocked down, suggesting that SIRT1 was involved in the epigenetic regulation of HIF-1$\alpha$. At last, phenformin, another mitochondrial complex1 inhibitor, was used to testify that the increased HIF-1a was not due to off target effects of MPP(+). Therefore, our results support a link between PD and SIRT1/HIF-1$\alpha$ signaling, which may serve as a clue for understanding PD.},

The purpose of this analysis is to systematically analyze the available data describing the biomarkers of cholesterol and its metabolites in the CSF of subjects with AD. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central database were systematically queried to collect studies that have evaluated the markers of cholesterol and its metabolites in the CSF of subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD and age-matched controls. Analysis of the published data shows that the levels of cholesterol are increased in MCI subjects; 24-hydroxycholesterol and 27-hydroxycholesterol are elevated in AD and MCI subjects compared to controls. There is a significant dysfunction of cholesterol metabolism in the CSF of AD subjects. This analysis indicates that in addition to the available biomarkers in the CSF, such as A$\beta$42, total tau, and phospho-tau, 24-hydroxycholesterol, 27-hydroxycholesterol, and cholesterol appear to be sensitive biomarkers for the evaluation of MCI and AD.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Purkinje cell loss has been documented in some, although not all, postmortem studies of essential tremor. Hence, there is considerable controversy concerning the presence of Purkinje cell loss in this disease. To date, few studies have been performed.
METHODS: Over the past 8 years, we have assembled 50 prospectively studied cases and 25 age-matched controls; none were reported in our previous large series of 33 essential tremor and 21 controls. In addition to methods used in previous studies, the current study used a random sampling approach to quantify Purkinje cells along the Purkinje cell layer with a mean of 217 sites examined in each specimen, allowing for extensive sampling of the Purkinje cell layer within the section. For the first time, we also quantified the distance between Purkinje cell bodies-a nearest neighbor analysis.
RESULTS: In the Purkinje cell count data collected from fifteen 100 {\texttimes} fields, cases had lower counts than controls in all three counting criteria (cell bodies, nuclei, and nucleoli; all P {\textless} 0.001). Purkinje cell linear density was also lower in cases than controls (all P {\textless} 0.001). Purkinje cell linear density obtained by random sampling was similarly lower in cases than controls in all three counting criteria (cell bodies, nuclei, and nucleoli, all P <= 0.005). In agreement with the quantitative Purkinje cell counts, the mean distance from one Purkinje cell body to another Purkinje cell body along the Purkinje cell layer was greater in cases than controls (P = 0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: These data provide support for the neurodegeneration of cerebellar Purkinje cells in essential tremor.},

Cerebellar ataxia is the most common presentation of CoQ10 deficiency, suggesting that the cerebellum might be selectively vulnerable to low levels of CoQ10 To investigate whether CoQ10 deficiency represents a common feature in the brains of MSA patients independent of the presence of COQ2 mutations, we studied CoQ10 levels in postmortem brains of 12 MSA, 9 Parkinson disease (PD), 9 essential tremor (ET) patients, and 12 controls. We also assessed mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme activities, oxidative stress, mitochondrial mass, and levels of enzymes involved in CoQ biosynthesis. Our studies revealed CoQ10 deficiency in MSA cerebellum, which was associated with impaired CoQ biosynthesis and increased oxidative stress in the absence of COQ2 mutations. The levels of CoQ10 in the cerebella of ET and PD patients were comparable or higher than in controls. These findings suggest that CoQ10 deficiency may contribute to the pathogenesis of MSA. Because no disease modifying therapies are currently available, increasing CoQ10 levels by supplementation or upregulation of its biosynthesis may represent a novel treatment strategy for MSA patients.},

	abstract = {SCOPE: The accumulation of misfolded $\alpha$-synuclein in dopaminergic neurons is the leading cause of Parkinson's disease (PD). Resveratrol (RV), a polyphenolic compound derived from grapes and red wine, exerts a wide range of beneficial effects via activation of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and induction of vitagenes. Here, we assessed the role of RV in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) induced mouse model of PD and explored its potential mechanisms.
METHODS AND RESULTS: RV and EX527, a specific inhibitor of SIRT1, were administered before and after MPTP treatment. RV protected against MPTP-induced loss of dopaminergic neurons, and decreases in tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine levels, as well as behavioral impairments. Meanwhile, RV administration activated SIRT1. Microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) was then deacetylated and redistributed from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, which provoked the autophagic degradation of $\alpha$-synuclein in dopaminergic neurons. Furthermore, EX527 antagonized the neuroprotective effects of RV by reducing LC3 deacetylation and subsequent autophagic degradation of $\alpha$-synuclein.
CONCLUSION: We showed that RV ameliorated both motor deficits and pathological changes in MPTP-treated mice via activation of SIRT1 and subsequent LC3 deacetylation-mediated autophagic degradation of $\alpha$-synuclein. Our observations suggest that RV may be a potential prophylactic and/or therapeutic agent for PD.},

Whether these postmortem changes are specific to ET remains to be investigated. We assessed CF-PC synaptic pathology in the postmortem cerebellum across a range of degenerative movement disorders [10 Parkinson's disease (PD) cases, 10 multiple system atrophy (MSA) cases, 10 spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) cases, and 20 ET cases] and 25 controls. We observed differences in terms of CF pathological features across these disorders. Specifically, PD cases and ET cases both had more CFs extending into the parallel fiber (PF) territory, but ET cases had more complex branching and increased length of CFs in the PF territory along with decreased CF synaptic density compared to PD cases. MSA cases and SCA1 cases had the most severely reduced CF synaptic density and a marked paucity of CFs extending into the PF territory. Furthermore, CFs in a subset of MSA cases formed collateral branches parallel to the PC layer, a feature not seen in other diagnostic groups. Using unsupervised cluster analysis, the cases and controls could all be categorized into four clusters based on the CF pathology and features of PC pathology, including counts of PCs and their axonal torpedoes. ET cases and PD cases co-segregated into two clusters, whereas SCA1 cases and MSA cases formed another cluster, separate from the control cluster. Interestingly, the presence of resting tremor seemed to be the clinical feature that separated the cases into the two ET-PD clusters. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that these degenerative movement disorders seem to differ with respect to the pattern of CF synaptic pathology they exhibit. It remains to be determined how these differences contribute to the clinical presentations of these diseases.},

	abstract = {Neuronal oscillations at beta frequencies (20-50 Hz) in the cortico-basal ganglia circuits have long been the leading theory for bradykinesia, the slow movements that are cardinal symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD). The beta oscillation theory helped to drive a frequency-based design in the development of deep brain stimulation therapy for PD. However, in contrast to this theory, here we have found that bradykinesia can be completely dissociated from beta oscillations in rodent models. Instead, we observed that bradykinesia is causatively regulated by the burst-firing pattern of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in a feed-forward, or efferent-only, mechanism. Furthermore, STN burst-firing and beta oscillations are two independent mechanisms that are regulated by different NMDA receptors in STN. Our results shift the understanding of bradykinesia pathophysiology from an interactive oscillatory theory toward a feed-forward mechanism that is coded by firing patterns. This distinct mechanism may improve understanding of the fundamental concepts of motor control and enable more selective targeting of bradykinesia-specific mechanisms to improve PD therapy.},

We explored EAAT biology in ET by quantifying EAAT2 and EAAT1 levels in the cerebellar dentate nucleus, and expanded our prior analysis of EAAT2 levels in the cerebellar cortex.
OBJECTIVE: To quantify EAAT2 and EAAT1 levels in the cerebellar dentate nucleus and cerebellar cortex of ET cases vs.
CONTROLS: METHODS: We used immunohistochemistry to quantify EAAT2 and EAAT1 levels in the dentate nucleus of a discovery cohort of 16~ET cases and 16 controls. Furthermore, we quantified EAAT2 levels in the dentate nucleus in a replicate cohort (61~ET cases, 25 controls). Cortical EAAT2 levels in all 77~ET cases and 41 controls were quantified.
RESULTS: In the discovery cohort, dentate EAAT2 levels were 1.5-fold higher in 16~ET cases vs. 16 controls (p~=~0.007), but EAAT1 levels did not differ significantly (p~=~0.279). Dentate EAAT2 levels were 1.3-fold higher in 61~ET cases vs. 25 controls in the replicate cohort (p~=~0.022). Cerebellar cortical EAAT2 levels were 20\% and 40\% lower in ET cases vs. controls in the discovery and the replicate cohorts (respective p values~=~0.045 and~{\textless}~0.001).
CONCLUSION: EAAT2 expression is enhanced in the ET dentate nucleus, in contrast to differentially reduced EAAT2 levels in the ET cerebellar cortex, which might reflect a compensatory mechanism to maintain excitation-inhibition balance in cerebellar nuclei.},

We studied 317 participants with SCAs1, 2, 3, and 6 from the Clinical Research Consortium for SCAs (CRC-SCA) and repeatedly measured the severity of ataxia for 2~years. SCA patients were divided into gait-onset and non-gait-onset (speech, vision, and hand dexterity) groups based on the initial presentation. In addition to demographic comparison, we employed regression models to study ataxia progression in these two groups after adjusting for age, sex, and pathological CAG repeats. The majority of SCA patients had gait abnormality as an initial presentation. The pathological CAG repeat expansions were similar between the gait-onset and non-gait-onset groups. In SCA1, gait-onset group progressed slower than non-gait-onset group, while gait-onset SCA6 group progressed faster than their counterpart. In addition, the disease presented 9~years later for SCA2 gait-onset group than non-gait-onset group. Initial symptoms of SCA3 did not influence age of onset or disease progression. The initial symptom in each SCA has a different influence on age of onset and motor progression. Therefore, gait and non-gait-onset groups of SCAs might represent different subtypes of the diseases.},

We quantified a broad range of postmortem features (Purkinje cell (PC) counts, PC axonal torpedoes, a host of associated axonal changes, heterotopic PCs, and hairy basket ratings) in 60 ET cases and 30 controls. Familial ET was defined using both liberal criteria (n~=~27) and conservative criteria (n~=~20). When compared with controls, ET cases had lower PC counts, more torpedoes, more heterotopic PCs, a higher hairy basket rating, an increase in PC axonal collaterals, an increase in PC thickened axonal profiles, and an increase in PC axonal branching. Familial and sporadic ET had similar postmortem changes, with few exceptions, regardless of the definition criteria. The PC counts were marginally lower in familial than sporadic ET (respective p values~=~0.059 [using liberal criteria] and 0.047 [using conservative criteria]). The PC thickened axonal profile count was marginally lower in familial ET than sporadic ET (respective p values~=~0.037 [using liberal criteria] and 0.17 [using conservative criteria]), and the PC axonal branching count was marginally lower in familial than sporadic ET (respective p values~=~0.045 [using liberal criteria] and 0.079 [using conservative criteria]). After correction for multiple comparisons, however, there were no significant differences. Overall, familial and sporadic ET cases share very similar cerebellar postmortem features. These data indicate that pathological changes in the cerebellum are a part of the pathophysiological cascade of events in both forms of ET.},

	abstract = {Individuals with damage to the cerebellum perform poorly in sensorimotor adaptation paradigms. This deficit has been attributed to impairment in sensory prediction error-based updating of an internal forward model, a form of implicit learning. These individuals can, however, successfully counter a perturbation when instructed with an explicit aiming strategy. This successful use of an instructed aiming strategy presents a paradox: In adaptation tasks, why do individuals with cerebellar damage not come up with an aiming solution on their own to compensate for their implicit learning deficit? To explore this question, we employed a variant of a visuomotor rotation task in which, before executing a movement on each trial, the participants verbally reported their intended aiming location. Compared with healthy control participants, participants with spinocerebellar ataxia displayed impairments in both implicit learning and aiming. This was observed when the visuomotor rotation was introduced abruptly (experiment 1) or gradually (experiment 2). This dual deficit does not appear to be related to the increased movement variance associated with ataxia: Healthy undergraduates showed little change in implicit learning or aiming when their movement feedback was artificially manipulated to produce similar levels of variability (experiment 3). Taken together the results indicate that a consequence of cerebellar dysfunction is not only impaired sensory prediction error-based learning but also a difficulty in developing and/or maintaining an aiming solution in response to a visuomotor perturbation. We suggest that this dual deficit can be explained by the cerebellum forming part of a network that learns and maintains action-outcome associations across trials.NEW \& NOTEWORTHY Individuals with cerebellar pathology are impaired in sensorimotor adaptation. This deficit has been attributed to an impairment in error-based learning, specifically, from a deficit in using sensory prediction errors to update an internal model. Here we show that these individuals also have difficulty in discovering an aiming solution to overcome their adaptation deficit, suggesting a new role for the cerebellum in sensorimotor adaptation tasks.},

	abstract = {Essential tremor (ET) is among the most common neurological diseases. Postmortem studies have noted a series of pathological changes in the ET cerebellum. Heterotopic Purkinje cells (PCs) are those whose cell body is mis-localized in the molecular layer. In neurodegenerative settings, these are viewed as a marker of the progression of neuronal degeneration. We (1) quantify heterotopias in ET cases vs. controls, (2) compare ET cases to other cerebellar degenerative conditions (spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) 1, 2, 3, and 6), (3) compare these SCAs to one another, and (4) assess heterotopia within the context of associated PC loss in each disease. Heterotopic PCs were quantified using a standard LH\&E-stained section of the neocerebellum. Counts were normalized to PC layer length (n-heterotopia count). It is also valuable to consider PC counts when assessing heterotopia, as loss of PCs extends both to normally located as well as heterotopic PCs. Therefore, we divided n-heterotopias by PC counts. There were 96 brains (43 ET, 31 SCA [12 SCA1, 7 SCA2, 7 SCA3, 5 SCA6], and 22 controls). The median number of n-heterotopias in ET cases was two times higher than that of the controls (2.6 vs. 1.2, p~{\textless}~0.05). The median number of n-heterotopias in the various SCAs formed a spectrum, with counts being highest in SCA3 and SCA1. In analyses that factored in PC counts, ET had a median n-heterotopia/Purkinje cell count that was three times higher than the controls (0.35 vs. 0.13, p~{\textless}~0.01), and SCA1 and SCA2 had counts that were 5.5 and 11 times higher than the controls (respective p~{\textless}~0.001). The median n-heterotopia/PC count in ET was between that of the controls and the SCAs. Similarly, the median PC count in ET was between that of the controls and the SCAs; the one exception was SCA3, in which the PC population is well known to be preserved. Heterotopia is a disease-associated feature of ET. In comparison, several of the SCAs evidenced even more marked heterotopia, although a spectrum existed across the SCAs. The median n-heterotopia/PC count and median PC in ET was between that of the controls and the SCAs; hence, in this regard, ET could represent an intermediate state or a less advanced state of spinocerebellar atrophy.},

METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search and a meta-analysis to study the weighted pooled OR of idiopathic cerebellar ataxia (IDCA) cases to controls or to hereditary ataxia (HA) for AGA seropositivity using fixed effect model.
RESULTS: Eleven studies were included, with a total of 847 IDCA cases, 1654 controls and 445 HA cases. IDCA cases had fourfold higher odds than controls (OR 4.28, 95\% CI 3.10 to 5.90) and twofold higher odds than HA cases (OR 2.23, 95\% CI 1.45 to 3.44) of having AGA seropositivity. Sensitivity analysis excluding the most weighted study, which accounted for 69\% of the total weight, still showed similar associations (IDCA vs controls, OR 3.18, 95\% CI 1.79 to 5.67 and IDCA vs HA, OR 1.72, 95\% CI 1.03 to 2.86, respectively). The subgroup analysis showed that, when compared with controls, IDCA cases of both East Asian and Western countries had approximately threefold to fourfold higher odds to have AGA seropositivity (OR 3.41, 95\% CI 1.67 to 6.97 and OR 4.53, 95\% CI 3.16 to 6.49, respectively), suggesting the lack of ethnic heterogeneity. The odds of AGA seropositivity for HA cases was not significantly higher than controls (OR 1.41, 95\% CI 0.82 to 2.44).
CONCLUSION: Our study indicates the association between AGA and IDCA, across different geographic regions.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postural tremor can sometimes occur in spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs). However, the prevalence and clinical characteristics of postural tremor in SCAs are poorly understood, and whether SCA patients with postural tremor have different ataxia progression is not known.
METHODS: We studied postural tremor in 315 patients with SCA1, 2, 3, and 6 recruited from the Clinical Research Consortium for Spinocerebellar Ataxias (CRC-SCA), which consists of 12 participating centers in the United States, and we evaluated ataxia progression in these patients from January 2010 to August 2012.
RESULTS: Among 315 SCA patients, postural tremor was most common in SCA2 patients (SCA1, 5.8\%; SCA2, 27.5\%; SCA3, 12.4\%; SCA6, 16.9\%; p = 0.007). SCA3 patients with postural tremor had longer CAG repeat expansions than SCA3 patients without postural tremor (73.67 {\textpm} 3.12 vs. 70.42 {\textpm} 3.96, p = 0.003). Interestingly, SCA1 and SCA6 patients with postural tremor had a slower rate of ataxia progression (SCA1, $\beta$ = -0.91, p {\textless} 0.001; SCA6, $\beta$ = -1.28, p = 0.025), while SCA2 patients with postural tremor had a faster rate of ataxia progression ($\beta$ = 1.54, p = 0.034). We also found that the presence of postural tremor in SCA2 patients could be influenced by repeat expansions of ATXN1 ($\beta$ = -1.53, p = 0.037) and ATXN3 ($\beta$ = 0.57, p = 0.018), whereas postural tremor in SCA3 was associated with repeat lengths in TBP ($\beta$ = 0.63, p = 0.041) and PPP2R2B ($\beta$ = -0.40, p = 0.032).
DISCUSSION: Postural tremor could be a clinical feature of SCAs, and the presence of postural tremor could be associated with different rates of ataxia progression. Genetic interactions between ataxia genes might influence the brain circuitry and thus affect the clinical presentation of postural tremor.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To identify pre-operative clinical and computerized spiral analysis characteristics that may help ascertain which patients with Essential Tremor (ET) will exhibit 'early tolerance' to ventral intermediate nucleus of thalamus (Vim) deep brain stimulation (DBS).
METHODS: Identification of comparative characteristics of defined cases of 'early tolerance' versus patients with sustained satisfactory response treated with Vim DBS surgery for medically-refractory ET, based on retrospective chart review by a clinician blinded to the findings of computerized spiral analysis.
RESULTS: Statistically significant differences in two spiral analysis indices, SWVI and DoS, were found in the dominant upper limbs of patients who developed 'early tolerance', whereas the clinical characteristics were not significantly different.
CONCLUSION: Objective measurements of upper limb kinematics using graphonomic tests like spiral analysis should be considered in the pre-operative evaluation for DBS, especially in the setting of moderate-severe predominantly action and proximal postural tremors.
SIGNIFICANCE: Ours is the first investigation looking into the pre-operative clinical and objective physiologic characteristics of the patients who develop 'early tolerance' to Vim DBS for the treatment of essential tremor. The study has significant implications for pre-operative evaluation and potential surgical target selection for the treatment of tremors.},
